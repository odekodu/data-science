    "A computer is an electronic device that takes input from the user, processes it according to a set of instructions, outputs the data and also temporarily or permantently stores the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is made up of Hardware and Software.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "These are the physical components of the computer. eg. monitor, mouse, printer etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "These are the components of the computer that perform specific tasks on a computer based on a collection of instructions. eg. whatsapp, facebook\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of software; Application and System software.\n",
    "\n",
    "`System software` acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer. It is designed to use and maintain the computer's hardware. eg. Operating Systems, Firmwares, Device Drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Appliation Software` is the software design to help users perform specific tasks on the computer. eg. Whatsapp Facebook etc.\n",

    "# Computer Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "`Computer Programming`, also known as coding, involves writing a well structured sets of instructions for a computer to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Computer Language`; Computers only understands binary (0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Programming languages` can be divided into two\n",
    "- Low-Level Languages\n",
    "- High-Level Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "`Low-level langeuges`\n",
    "- Machine Language\n",
    "- Assembly Language\n",
    "\n",
    "`Machine Language`; This executes directly on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Assembly Language`; This needs an assebler to be converted into a machine language before being executed by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "`High-Level Languages`; The require compilers or interpreters to be converted into what the computer can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Compiler`; This converts the entire code at once to a language the computer can understand `(Faster than Interpreters)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Interpreter`; Converts one line at a time; each time the line is encountered. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Data`; This is a collection of values. It can be either:\n",
    "- Digital Data\n",
    "- Analog Data\n",
    "\n",
    "`Digital Data`; They are programmed sequencially and jumps from one value to the next. They are discrete and discontinious.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Analog Data`; They fluctuate infinitely with a specific range\n",
    "\n",
    "`Analog Devices`; Speakers, Amplifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "`Data` can be converted from digital to analog and vise-versa with use of `DAC` and `ADC` converters\n",
    "\n",
    "`Information`; This is processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bits and Bytes`: A bit (b) it the unit for measuring network speed and a byte (B) is unit of measure a data in a computer. `1B = 8b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Variables`: Use the name values stored. They should be relatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Datatype`: Used to mark the type of data so the computer know the operations to apply to the data.\n",
    "eg. Number (Integer, Float), Text, Boolean, Null.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Type Checking`; This checking for operations that doesn't belong to a data-type. It can be done during compilation or `run-time`"
