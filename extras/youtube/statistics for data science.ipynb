    "### What is statistics?\n",
    "Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing `data`, `for better decision making`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is data?\n",
    "It is facts or pieces of information that can be `measured`.\n",
    "    e.g: Measure the IQ of a class\n",
    "    {98, 89, 99, 50, 94}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of statistics\n",
    "1. Descriptive statistics\n",
    "    It consists of organizing and summerizing of data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. inferential Statistics\n",
    "    This is a technique where the `data` that have been measured is used to form `conclusions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Imagine`: Classroom of math students (20)\n",
    "Marks = {90, 67, 78, 89, 67, 87, 66, 89, 88, 77, 87, ...}\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive stats question:\n",
    "What is the avg mark of the students?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential stats question:\n",
    "Are the marks of the students of this classroom similar to the marks of the maths classroom in the college?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here college is the `population` and the classroom is the `sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population(N) and Sample(n)\n",
    "Population(N) is the entire data collection while Sample(n) is a selected piece of the data.\n",
    "    e.g. Elections\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Techniques\n",
    "Selecting a sample technique is completely dependent of the use case. \n",
    "You can combine multiple techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Simple Random Sampling`: Every member of the population(N) has an equal chance of being selected for the sample(n).\n",
    "    e.g. Election exit poll needs people that voted.\n",
    "2. `Stratified Sampling (Group Sampling)`: This is the technique where the population (N) is split into `non-overlapping groups` called `strata`.\n",
    "    e.g. Sampling based on gender, age group, profession\n",
    "3. `Systematic Sampling`: Picks an nth item in a population(N).\n",
    "4. `Convenience Sampling`: This technique picks only items that have interest in the topic. \n",
    "    e.g. Stackoverflow Surveys is for developers only.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "A variable is a property that can take on any value. e.g. Height, Age, Weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of variable\n",
    "1. Quantitive variables\n",
    "    They can be measured numerically \n",
    "    e.g Age, Height\n",
    "2. Qualitive/Categorical variables.\n",
    "    Based on some characteritics we can derive qualitative variables\n",
    "    e.g Gender, Profession, Age Groups, Blood Group, Cloth size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Quantitive variables\n",
    "- Discrete Variables\n",
    "    Basically whole numbers. e.g Bank Accounts, No. of students in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continious Variables\n",
    "    e.g Height, Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Measurement Scales\n",
    "There are four types of measured variables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal data (Categorical Data)\n",
    "    e.g Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal\n",
    "    Here the order of the data matters but value doesn't.\n",
    "    e.g Ranks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval\n",
    "    Here value and order matters, natural zero is not present.\n",
    "    e.g Temperature, Age Group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "flower / Frequency / Cumulative Frequency\n",
    "Rose / 3 / 3\n",
    "Lilly / 4 / 7\n",
    "Sunflower / 2 / 9\n",
    "\n",
    "The cumulative frequence of the last item is the lenght of the items \n",
    "\n",
    "`Note`: For discrete variable use bar chart, continious variables use histogram.\n",
    "    PDF is use for smoothing of histograms."
